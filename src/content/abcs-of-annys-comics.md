Here I distill [my comics]('/all') creation process into an alphabetical summary. This summary ends with U, since you are the audience of my art :)

**Autobiographical**: Some of my comics are based on my life.

**Batched**: While they may appear off-the-cuff, my comics are drawn in batches from ideas accumulated over weeks, months, or even years.

**Cabinet**: I have a cabinet full of filled notebooks. I write fast from learning 3 languages before I was 12. I still compulsively write and journal.

**Democratic**: The materials used (post-it notes + sharpies) and ideas expressed are meant for everyone. This is intentional as I believe art should be available and understandable for the masses, not only the rich.

**Easy to draw** and understand: Complex ideas are rarely captured with simple lines. Still I aspire to capture the most with the least, like [this Chinese watercolor](https://www.ebay.com/itm/125284895695) which captured an entire landscape with black ink + water.

**Fast to draw**: Drawing was a childhood hobby and I still enjoy it. As an artist I’m racing against time: a batch of comics either gets created now or never.

**Grand**: I like to ideate in grand (large) notebooks, yes, the paper variety. Writing first drafts on paper feels faster and more decisive.

**Hand-drawn**: My comics have a distinctive look, so you know it’s mine and not a meme.

**Inspiration**: Ideas come to me easily. What’s harder is making time to draw.

**JK**: I see myself as the **joker**, the one pointing out what others are too busy to notice/too polite to say.

**Laughter**: We can use more of these.

**Memories**: I often mine these for inspiration, but it's hard to escape reminiscing for hours.

**News**: Sometimes I’m triggered, other times I notice a pattern. History might not repeat, but it often rhymes.

**Old**: I’m drawn to old things, discarded things, and things that don’t change, instead of the latest hype that can change within a year.

**Post-it notes**: Yes this office staple can contain amusing thoughts. This was inspired by [Chaz Hutton’s comics](https://www.instagram.com/instachaaz/?hl=en).

**Quiet**: I need quiet and offline time to reflect, write, and draw.

**Refinement**: I put away filled notebooks for at least a few weeks before combing them for ideas. Most ideas improve with time and edits.

**Sharpie**: Is a humble pen that produces great comics, including these by [Keith Knight](https://kchronicles.com/).

**Throw out**: I throw out most of my old notebooks after reading them, and most of the ideas too since they don’t fit the constrained space and medium.

**U**: I hope you like the comics and share'em :)
