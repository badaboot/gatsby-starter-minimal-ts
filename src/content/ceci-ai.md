[The painting](https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/painting-week-rene-magritte-treachery-images/) is not a pipe. It's a representation of a pipe.

The picture below it is not AI. It's representative of AI-generated images.

The original painting was good; Magritte worked in advertising before turning to art.

His painting became famous due to its [meta-message/subtext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtext), which is relevant today.
