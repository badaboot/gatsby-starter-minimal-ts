Mandarin was my first language but I’m rusty at it since I left China as a child. I want to brush up on the language before I visit China as an adult.
My requirements
I need a Chinese chatting partner who gives me sensible Chinese responses. Chatting with a person would be nice, but I’d need to plan around their schedule. I’ve been curious about chatbots created using LLM (large language models), so why not give bots a chance?
The bot does not have to remember our previous conversations, so it can be a basic chatbot like Eliza, a bare-bones chatbot developed in the 1960’s.
For full transparency I have a solid foundation with Chinese: I read newspapers comfortably when I left China. That was over a dozen years ago and my reading ability has decreased, while listening comprehension remained decent.

Along with the chatbot I’m using:
Mac’s built-in text-to-speech input, which reads Chinese snippets. I recognize more Chinese text by sound than by reading
Google Translate to understand some Chinese characters (Chinese → English), and also to translate what I want to say (English → Chinese). I make it large so I can see the components of each Chinese character

A lined notebook to write Chinese characters in. This is a vestige of my school days in China where we wrote letters non-stop, which helps memorization. Back then the teacher cared about the order of each stroke. These details are less important now than basic comprehension of each character

Poe AI + Chinese partner
I found Poe AI by Googling for Chinese language bots. Poe AI is a platform providing access to multiple such bots. After chatting with a few I picked the ChinesePartner chatbot since it corrects my Chinese grammar and vocabulary. It also has an encouraging and friendly tone, whereas most LLMs (large language models) sound formal and cold.
It also provides a copy of the response in English, so I don’t have to have Google Translate open to understand the response. I still end up using my Mac’s text-to-speech app to pronounce the Chinese and Google Translate to look up synonyms.
Side notes
I switch topics quite frequently when chatting with the bot to practice certain words, which can seem rude or uncaring if I was conversing with a person. Since this is a bot I don’t have to maintain a sense of normalcy
When I started using the bot I conversed with it to use up all the daily credits, whereas now I use it as an more advanced dictionary, to find the nuance of words eg. refer to the prompts below
Chinese has a fifth vowel that looks like u with an umlaut: ‘ü’. I tried to write ‘woman’ in Chinese with ‘nu’ but got ‘angry’ 怒 and ‘slave’ 奴 instead. I had to write nü to get the right character 女, which is spelled as ‘nv’ in pinying
Useful prompts
What does “a certain phrase or word” mean?
Eg. “肥了你们” in Google Translate means “Got fat on you”, but it means your work has benefited others without benefiting yourself
What's the difference between word 1 and word2?
Eg. “思考” and “想“ both mean think
Does this word have a positive or negative connotation?
Eg. 乖 is “good” when describing children, but potentially bad when describing an adult
Pricing
I use the free tier on Poe AI which is 3000 daily credits, after which the chat is disabled. Each response costs credits. The credits reset at 4 pm PST the next day. I can pay for additional credits but the daily limit feels like a precious resource; if I don’t use it I lose it.
There are other chatbots out there eg. Anthropic’s Claude plus hosted text-generation LLMs on Huggingface, but I don’t use them because they sound formal. The Chinese teacher bot sounds friendly and it corrects my grammar and vocabulary, which is what I want more than formality.
The only downside is it can be inconvenient when I have time to learn Chinese and I’ve run out of credits; then I patiently wait for another session with the Chinese Teacher bot.
Comparing the AI chat to
Other learning apps eg. Duolingo
Apps usually have their own agenda and learning paths, which feels constrictive for a formerly-native Chinese learner like me. Also, can anyone fully master a language with only 5 minutes a day?
Many of them are phone apps, and I dislike the phone as a learning tool since it’s a host of distractions. Its small screen feels detrimental to learning the Chinese letters, which, due to its compositional nature (see Chinese radicals), needs a larger screen to be appreciated
A real person as a language teacher
A real person would be better for accountability, and can give me more pointers eg. grammatical patterns across various sentences, and to clarify what I actually meant to put it into more correct and concise terms
Scheduling and cost can be a concern. Also I might feel embarrassed if I don’t improve between lessons, whereas a lack of progress won’t embarrass a robot (but embarrasses me, oh well)
Chinese books
Any book is easier on the eyes: no glare
Having a chat partner is more interactive than a book, which can be easy to zone out of/drift into passive learning. The interactivity of a chat partner keeps me on my toes
Questions
How companies who host LLMs will monetize?
Poe AI offers a monthly subscription, which might not work if people are unwilling to pay. Maybe it’ll start featuring ads based on user data to pay for the infrastructure they run on. The biggest winners in this game remain the cloud providers (Google with GCP, Amazon with AWS, and Microsoft with Azure)
Given how easy translation technology is, would people still make time for learning languages?
Yes but rarely: anyone can use Google translate, but translation is different from understanding. The difficulty shifted from not having resources to having too many resources. The challenge is making the time and focusing, which is rare in this age of distraction
