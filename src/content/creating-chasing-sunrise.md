This game is published! You can [check it out here](https://badaboot.itch.io/chasing-sunrise).

This is the third of three interactive fiction stories; they’re standalones and available on [my itch.io page](https://badaboot.itch.io/).

### What is the game about?

This horror-comedy is "[**Get out**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Out)" meets "[**Squid Game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game)", with elements of selfishness vs sacrifice. I’m also inspired by the frailty of human connections in our rapidly changing world; eg. some of us engage more with chatbots than with other people.

You as the player, can choose between truth-finding or the status-quo. There's a price to pay either way :)

### What is my game dev process?

I've refined this process thrice over the three stories:

1. Hammer out idea on paper:
   - The page count helps me gauge how fleshed-out an idea is
   - Ideally the idea is **fleshed out** enough and I'm still **passionate enough** to make it
2. Type out idea in Google docs
   - Type out a blurb, character + settings, and the actual story (plot + words)
   - Ensure all the branches/endings are sensible. If there is no branching than this can be a regular story/comics
   - Check the story for length: ideally the story is not too long, but long enough to be worthwhile
3. Add the story to [Twine](https://twinery.org/)

   - I use the [Harlowe](https://twinery.org/cookbook/markup/harlowe/harlowe_markup.html) story format as it has the most minimal UI
   - I reuse CSS from previous projects for styling
   - At this point I get my husband to play-test it, to improve the story

     <span>I print out the script and doodle on it with a pen to prototype different camera angles.</span>

4. Draw and add illustrations

   - The good news is **I draw fast**, since drawing is my oldest hobby
   - The bad news is I need to **psych myself up** to draw, since I only draw occasionally now. I also plan the shots in the picture above
   - After adding the images I get my hubby to play-test the story again. He may suggest adding more images/changing images, and which sounds to add

5. Add sounds
   - I make a list of sounds and search for them on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
   - I save the attribution for the sounds used and add them to the credits page
   - After adding sounds I get my husband to play-test again before publishing the game on itch.io. I usually submit the game to a few game jams to get more feedback

### A note on my drawing process

<img src='/drawings.png' alt='my Sharpie drawings on white paper' />
<span>A page of my illustrations for the game; I wrote and illustrated this game myself</span>

- I draw on **looseleaf paper** to trace previous pages. The pages might be printed on one side, since I’m into reuse-reduce-recycle
- I draw by hand using a **pencil and Sharpie**; the pencil is erased digitally, and the Sharpie pen really smells
- I use black and white because it’s graphic and simple. I’m a minimalist at heart and took art lessons in China, where we tried to emulate the black and white watercolors. I use Sharpies for a faster-paced world, but the minimalist principle still applies

### Fun fact

The most time-intensive part is NOT drawing or ideation, but the **word-smithing** eg. editing the story to have the minimal word count while maximizing impact. The longer the story the longer the editing.
