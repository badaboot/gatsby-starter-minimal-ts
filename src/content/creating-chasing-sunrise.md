This game is published! You can check it out for free here and leave feedback in the comments.
This is the third of three interactive fiction stories; they’re all standalones and available on itch.io. Play them …

What is the game about?
This horror-comedy is "Get out" meets "Squid Game", with elements of selfishness vs sacrifice. I’m also inspired by how hard it is to form human connections in the age of technology; every new technology seems to make us more isolated eg. chat to a chatbot instead of a human.
You, as the player, can decide between the harder truth-finding route or the easy status-quo route, which might end up hard. You’ll need to play to find out :)

A page of my illustrations for the game; I wrote and illustrated this game myself. Game dev is NOT easy. There's a lot of time to refine the idea and produce assets.

What is my game dev process?
This is my third interactive fiction game. I’ve applied the same process three times, with some tweaking:
Hammer out idea on notebook:
I use pen and paper, and use page count to gauge how passionate I am about an idea/how fleshed-out the idea is
Type out idea in Google docs
Type out a blurb, character bank, and the actual story
Check the story for length: I prefer to err on the side of being too short than too long
Ensure all the branches/endings are sensible
Add the story to Twine
I use the Harlowe story format as it has the most minimal UI. It’s easy to get started, and I copy-paste CSS from previous projects for styling

Draw illustrations
Need to psych myself up

I print out the script and doodle on it with a pen to prototype different camera angles. My simplified drawing style can look comedic but the theme is existential horror, so I can swing between funny and tragic, and it’s a delicate balance because one needs the funny to counteract the tragic, to prevent the story from being too depressing
I draw by hand using a pencil and Sharpie; the Sharpie pen really smells
I use black and white because it’s graphic and simple. I’m a minimalist at heart and took art lessons in China, where we used paint brushes to try to emulate the black and white watercolors from Chinese artists of old. Those artists could paint birds with a few brushstrokes. My medium is quite different; I use Sharpies for a faster-paced world, but I hope one day I can be as expressive as they were one day

A page of illustrations. Notice I draw on looseleaf paper since I can trace on previous pages. These are one-sided on already printed paper, since I’m a reuse-reduce-recycle kind of person.

Add sounds
I make a list of sounds and search for them on pixabay
I make sure to save the attribution for the sounds I use, and add them to the credits page
I edit the photos in Google Photos, where my photos are backed up. There are definitely better editing tools out there

It’s good to have a process to iterate over.
Need to have lots of polish eg. wordsmithing.
Thanks to my husband for encouraging me to make games and also playtesting them, and giving me actionable feedback :)
