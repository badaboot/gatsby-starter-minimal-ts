This is the third of three interactive fiction stories; they’re standalones and available on [my itch.io page](https://badaboot.itch.io/).

### What's the game about?

This horror-comedy is based on "[**Get out**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Out)" + "[**Squid Game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game)" + **AI hype**. I’m also inspired by the frailty of human connections in our rapidly changing world; eg. some of us engage more with chatbots than with other people.

You as the player can choose between truth-finding or the status-quo. There's a price to pay either way :)

### What is my game dev process?

I've refined this process thrice over the three stories:

1. Hammer out ideas on paper:
   - The page count helps me gauge how fleshed-out an idea is
   - Ideally the idea is **fleshed-out** and I'm still **passionate enough** to make it
2. Type out idea in Google docs
   - Type out a blurb + character + settings, and the plot + story
   - Ensure all branches/endings are sensible. If there's only one ending then this is a regular story/comic
   - Check the story for length: ideally the story is **not too long** AND **long enough** to be worthwhile
3. Add the story to [Twine](https://twinery.org/), an open-source tool that publishes to HTML

   - I use the [Harlowe](https://twinery.org/cookbook/markup/harlowe/harlowe_markup.html) story format due to its minimal UI
   - I reuse CSS from previous projects for styling
   - At this point I get my husband to play-test it for feedback

4. Draw and add illustrations

   - The good news is **I draw fast**, since drawing is my oldest hobby
   - The bad news is I need to **psych myself up** to draw, since I only draw occasionally now. I also plan the shots in the picture above
   - After adding the images I get my hubby to play-test the story again. He may suggest adding/changing images, and which sounds to add

5. Add sounds
   - I make a list of sounds and search for them on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
   - I save the attribution for the sounds used and add them to the credits page
   - After adding sounds I get my husband to play-test again before publishing the game on itch.io. I usually submit the game to a few game jams to get more feedback

### A note on my drawing process

<img src='/drawings.png' alt='my Sharpie drawings on white paper' />
<span>A page of my illustrations for the game; I wrote and illustrated all 3 games myself</span>

- I draw on **looseleaf paper** to trace previous pages. The pages might be printed on one side, since I’m a reuse-reduce-recycle person
- I draw by hand using a **pencil and Sharpie**; the pencil is removed digitally and the Sharpie pen really smells
- I use **black and white** because it’s graphic and simple. I’m a minimalist at heart and took art lessons in China, where we emulated the [old masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Masters_of_the_Ming_dynasty) using black and white watercolors. Now I use a Sharpie, but the same principle applies

### Fun fact

The most time-intensive part is NOT drawing or ideation, but the **word-smithing** eg. editing the story to minimize word count while maximizing emotional impact. The longer the story the longer the editing.
