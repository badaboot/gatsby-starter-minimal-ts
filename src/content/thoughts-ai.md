### On vibe coding

1. It's easy to describe a simple game to be implemented by AI; it's harder to reliably describe a **nested SQL query** with joins and aggregations. **Human language -> SQL** is a challenge, and full-stack code-gen platforms like [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) are running into it

2. The **law of diminishing returns** apply; vibe-coding is great for getting 0 to 1, but every step is prone to failure. I use it to prototype game mechanics; if I like the direction I develop the rest the old-fashioned way.

### Image/video generation

3. I want to learn **image editing skills** and **video-editing skills** when the results are a little off. **Re-generating** changes the image too much.

### Financials

4. It's hard for smaller companies eg. [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) to compete with the giants eg. Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT. Especially Google: they have [Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/) and deep pockets, and is more generous on the free tier.

5. AI tools are cheap and everywhere now; their prices will rise after a **consolidation**. Similar to how Uber and Lyft's fares were low to drive taxi companies out of business.

6. How to prevent **vendor lock-in**?
   - One way is to use open source models (they're on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)), but it's hard to compete against better-funded models.
   - Another is to continue to develop your core skills (eg. coding/drawing/editing) and don't become addicted to AI tools
