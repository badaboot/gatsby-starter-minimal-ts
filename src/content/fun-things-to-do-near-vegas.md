My husband and I moved to the greater Vegas area and found cool places to share. They're grouped by city name.

### Vegas off of the strip

**University of Las Vegas**: Has a [free-admissions art gallery](https://www.unlv.edu/unit/marjorie-barrick-museum) featuring local artists.

[**Nevada SPCA**](https://nevadaspca.org/): This location near Allegiant stadium offers bunnies, cats, and guinea pigs. They also offer free biscuits to feed the doggos :)

**Chinatown**: [Zen Curry](https://www.curryzen.com/) restaurant has great curry and katsudon.

**Silverton casino**:

- Has a free family-friendly [mermaid show](https://silvertoncasino.com/hotel/aquarium-mermaid-show/) happening every hour
- Is in the same building as the largest **Bass Pro** shop in the US. The shop has a large taxidermy collection of lions, bears, and even a giraffe. It has a large gun collection too
- Is close to the [Lion Ranch Habitat](https://lionhabitatranch.org), which has lions, ostriches, emus, and other animals

### Boulder City

Boulder City is home of the [Hoover Dam](https://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/) and antique stores; it's a half day-trip from Vegas.

[**Dilinger’s restaurant**](https://www.thedillinger.com/): this place has rifles for door-handles and offers American food, including sandwiches and chili soup without beans (because the chef doesn’t like beans).

[**Boulder Dam hotel**](https://www.boulderdamhotel.com/):

- Has a museum inside chronicling how the dam was built and the history of the city
- Also has a local artist’s gallery; it's worth a look

### Henderson

This town borders Vegas. It's quieter and you'll need a car.

**Ethel M**:

- Has a [cactus garden](https://www.ethelm.com/en-us/locations/henderson-flagship/cactus-garden) with labeled plants; it's free to visit
- Sells high-end chocolates and has free samples inside the store
- Nearby is [Mama Pam](https://mamapamlv.com/), a reliably good Thai restaurant

[**Bird preserve**](https://www.cityofhenderson.com/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/337/): This short and flat route is surrounded by birds. We saw ducks and hawks flying overhead.

**Black Bear diner**: This American restaurant offers comfort food in a homely setting.

**The District**:

- Is an upscale strip mall with a Whole Foods. It hosts local vendors on Saturdays
- Is close to [Toro sushi](https://torosushivegas.com/), a reliably good restaurant. It has udon soups and katsudon too
- Is close to [Paseo Verde library](https://hendersonlibraries.com/paseo-verde-library), the biggest library in Henderson. It has a cute cafe with fruits and relaxing music

These are some of the local highlights. There's more to Vegas than just the strip :)
