My husband and I moved to the greater Vegas area over 10 months ago and spent our weekends exploring new places. Here are some highlights from experience, grouped by city name.

Vegas off of the strip

Ailene Pasco: Venus at rest 2024
University of Las Vegas:
Has a small art gallery that is free and open to the public featuring local artists
Chinatown:
Zen Curry restaurant: has great curry and katsu-don
Has an Asian grocery store
SPCA: this is a sizable location that offers bunnies, cats, and guinea pigs. They also have free biscuits for the visitors to feed the doggos

Taxidermied moose in Bass Pro
Silverton casino:
Has free, family-friendly mermaid show
Is in the same building as the largest Bass Pro shop in the US. It has a large taxidermy collection of lions, bears, and even a giraffe. Its large guns collection always surprise me each time we visit
Is close to the Lion Ranch, which has lions, ostriches, and emus

Boulder City

Boulder City is home of the Hoover Dam and antique stores. Its small downtown is full of statues and local shops. It’s worth a day-trip.
Dilinger’s restaurant: this place has rifles for door-handles and offers American food, including sandwiches and chili soup without beans (because the chef doesn’t like beans)
Inside Boulder Dam hotel has a museum: it chronicles how the dam was built and the history of the city. The hotel also has a local artist’s gallery which is also worth a look

Henderson: borders Vegas

Ethel M. cactus garden

Ethel M: has a free cactus garden and sells high-end chocolates. They also offer free chocolate samples inside the store
Nearby is Mama Pam, a reliably good Thai restaurant
Another good Thai place is Connection Thai Sushi, which also offers, you guessed it, sushi
Juan’s flaming fajitas: sit-down place with good ambiance, and yes the flames are real. I like their pozole soup. It’s in the Water district
Bird preserve: it’s a short and flat route surrounded by birds. Watch out for water birds like ducks and also hawks flying overhead
Barnes and Noble:
I love this place due to the atmosphere: it feels calm and the air smells like coffee, thanks to the built-in Starbucks. Also the Starbucks folks can checkout books here, which is pretty cool
It’s in Sunset Station, the same strip mall as a discount alcohol place and Best Buy. This Best Buy has a decent lego collection
Black Bear diner: this American restaurant offers comfort food in a homely setting
The District: ← an upscale strip mall
Has a Whole Foods and events with local vendors on Saturdays. We got our skull couple statue at one of the vendors there
It’s close to Turo sushi: my husband and I visit this place often. They also offer udon soups and katsu in addition to sushi
Is close to Paseo Verde library, the biggest library branch in Henderson. The library has a cute cafe with fresh fruits and relaxing music

These are some of the local highlights. I hope that’s enough for you to get started.
