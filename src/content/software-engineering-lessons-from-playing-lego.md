<span>Pacman arcade game made from Legos</span>

My husband and I put together a [2651 piece lego](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/pac-man-arcade-10323) (PAC-MAN Arcade) within three days part-time. The number of pieces looked daunting; it’s so high that the box was rated 18+.

How did we put it together so quickly?

### Practice

The above Lego sets had lots of symmetrical parts, hence the instructions are similar. By building quickly we quickly accumulated practice building the similar parts over and over again.

### Specialization

I group similar pieces into piles while my husband tackles the building. This organizational step slows us down at the beginning but we quickly make up the time. It’s much faster than finding pieces in an unsorted pile.

### Teamwork

After we put together 7 out of 20 sections we took a break before blazing through the rest of the sections. Each of us took a break while the other person pushed through. Also when the parts don’t fit we troubleshoot together.

We are both software engineers and I thought the lessons also applies to software engineering, which exemplifies specialization and teamwork. The practice part also applies, since solving similar problems helps one solve problems faster.
