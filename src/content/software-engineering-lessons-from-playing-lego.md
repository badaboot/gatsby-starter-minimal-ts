My husband and I put together a 1700+ piece lego within three hours on a Sunday afternoon. We picked it because it looks similar to our tuxedo cat, even though the number of pieces looked daunting. It’s so high that the toy was rated 18+.
How did we put it together so quickly?

Practice
This specific lego set has lots of symmetrical parts, hence the instructions are similar. By building quickly we quickly accumulated practice building the similar parts over and over again
Specialization
I group similar pieces into piles while my husband tackles most of the building. This means I’m mostly busy at the beginning, and can build parts of the lego later on. We did this before with other Lego sets; it’s much faster than finding pieces in an unsorted pile
Teamwork
After we put together our first batch of 7 our of 20 sections we took a break. I was ok with the build taking multiple days but hubby wanted more. He asked if I wanted to join. We blazed through the rest of the sections with each of us taking a wee break while the other person pushed through. Also when parts don’t quite fit another person can take a look and troubleshoot together.

We are both software engineers and I thought the above also applies to software engineering, which also exemplifies specialization and is a team sport. The practice part also applies since those who solve programming problems the fastest tend to have solved similar problems before.
