I want to re-learn Chinese and I remember the text best after writing it. I’ve already filled notebooks with Chinese letters and want something else; ideally something that doesn't pile up.

I type on the laptop with pinyin but that teaches reading more than writing, as all I need to do is to select the right character combination. I still need to write to remember which characters to use.
So I busted out a drawing scroll from my mom. It is environmentally-friendly and easy on my eyes. It uses water as ink, has marked squares for visual reference, and dries quickly for the next round of practice.

I write Chinese radicals daily on the board, and sometimes new words I jotted down on my notebook. I get much more practice out of it than apps downloaded on my phone.

The mat teaches me:

### Patience

After filling up the scroll I wait for the ink to dry; the letters disappear quite quickly, almost magically.

### Practice makes better

Usually the first time I’m writing a letter it’s imperfect, but the writing gets better as I mindfully improve. Writing with a brush also makes me feel artistic; this feeds into the compositional aspect of Chinese writing, where characters are often made up of smaller characters.

### Best solutions can be low-tech

My brain is quieter and more focused since I’m offline. It also means fewer distractions, more mindfulness, and less eye strain. I appreciate how the scroll takes up physical space: it's a visual reminder to practice. It is almost daring me to write again and fill it with new characters.

There are plenty of apps on practicing writing Chinese but this offline mat is my favorite. While it doesn’t have any metrics (eg. number of days used, number of letters written, etc), it helps me remember the characters with minimal distraction. It fulfills the intended purpose.
