I want to re-learn Chinese and need help with remembering the characters. I remember the text after writing it, so I need help with writing Chinese.

I've tried:

#### 1. fill notebooks with Chinese characters

I’m already doing this and want something else; ideally I'd save my notebooks for something I'll re-read.

#### 2. get a Chinese writing app

I've downloaded phone apps but they have a very structured way of learning and require too many clicks. Also I can't handle the eye-strain.

#### 3. write on laptop with pinying

I type on the laptop with pinyin but that teaches **reading more than writing**, eg. spotting the right character combination. Ideally I know which characters to write without visual aid.

#### 4. write on a writing scroll

This one is from my mom. It is environmentally-friendly and easy on the eyes (no eye strain). It uses water as ink, has marked squares for visual reference, and dries quickly for the next round of practice.

I write [Chinese radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character_radicals) on the scroll and new words I jotted down on my notebook. I get much more practice out of it than apps downloaded on my phone.

## The mat teaches me:

#### Patience

After filling up the scroll I wait for the ink to dry; the letters disappear quite quickly, almost magically.

#### Practice makes better

Letter-writing improves with mindful tweaks: the initial letter might look off, but it gets better with practice. Writing with a brush also makes me feel artistic, similar to the [watercolor artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_painting) of old.

#### Best solutions can be low-tech

My brain is quieter and more focused since I’m **offline**. It means fewer distractions, more mindfulness, and less eye strain. I also appreciate how the scroll **takes up space**: it's a visual reminder to practice.

There are apps on writing Chinese but the writing mat is my favorite. While it doesn’t have any metrics (eg. number of days used, number of letters written, etc), it helps me remember the characters with minimal distraction. It fulfills the intended purpose.
