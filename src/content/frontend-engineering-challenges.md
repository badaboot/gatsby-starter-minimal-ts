After 8 years I know it's more than pixel-pushing.

1. **Everyone has an opinion** on the UI including your users, colleagues, and their grandmas. Only the database people know what's [optimistic vs pessimistic locking](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/129329/optimistic-vs-pessimistic-locking), but the general population have an opinion on a button size and color, or font style and size. People will disagree and grumble about the decision.

2. **A good frontend** is like good design. It's **hard to describe**, yet users will know it when they see it.

3. A new framework or library comes out every month, especially in AI advancements. AI models can run in-browser with **web-llm** and **web GPU**. It has performance implications; the browser can crash, preventing the user from doing any work.

4. Many **full-stack engineers** started as frontend engineers who went above and beyond, but the reverse is rare. I've yet to meet a backend/devops engineer who enjoys frontend work; most avoid it like the plague.

5. Frontend is the top layer of a stack. The user will experience all the inefficiences/deficiencies throughout the stack, and they'll **blame it on the UI**.

6. On new projects I'm often torn between laying the foundations and prettifying the UI. Laying the foundations is critical, but people expect frontend engineers to make the UI pretty; **expectation manangement** is key.
